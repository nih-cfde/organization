# CFDE Organizational Resources

## Onboarding

New members *must* be formally onboarded to gain access to our 
GitHub, mailing list, calendars and other internal documents. Qualified members can sponsor new members by entering new member details in the [Onboarding Form]( https://www.nih-cfde.org/onboarding-form/) on the [CFDE Website](https://www.nih-cfde.org/). A more detailed introduction and onboarding instructions can be found at the [Welcome to the CFDE](https://cfde-welcome-to-cfde.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/master/) web page.

If you are having trouble accessing something you believe you should have access to, please visit our
[Onboarding Help](OnboardingHelp.md) page or 
email the [HelpDesk](mailto:support@cfde.atlassian.net).
