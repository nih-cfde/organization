## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| Branch | Since many people can work on a document simultaneously, when anyone edits a document, GitHub makes that change on a different "branch" so each person can make their own changes and then submit their version to the group for approval via a Pull Request. |
| Commit | Essentially, this is synonymous with saving. When you are making changes to a document in your branch, you need to commit your changes before you leave the page. If you are making a lot of changes, you can do many commits and submit all the changes on your branch as one Pull Request. |
| Issues | Issues are ways to make comments or requests in a repository. |
| Merge | Once you have submitted a Pull Request and it has been approved via review, you can merge your changes, at which point your version of the document is the version displayed in the repository. |
| Organization | Our GitHub organization is https://github.com/nih-cfde. This is the location on the web where you can access all of the CFDE GitHub repositories. We also have a repository called "organization", which is a folder that contains all the meta information about our organization. |
| Pull Request | A Pull Request or "PR" is the main way to share your own edits to documents in a repository. |
| Repository | Each repository or "repo" is a self-contained collection of documents and code. There can be any number of repositories in our organization, and anyone in our group can make a new repository. See the [Checklist for Adding a New Repository](NewRepositoryGuide.md) for more information. |
| Review Request | To ensure that errors are not accidently introduced into important code and documents, all Pull Requests must be reviewed by at least one other person before they are merged into the official version. |
| Team | Each member of our organization will be assigned to one or more teams. The team(s) you are in determines what repositories you have edit access for. By default, everyone has at least read access to all CFDE repositories. Teams can also be tagged into conversations. Anyone in our group can make new teams. |

## Navigating our Organization

All Common Fund Data Ecosystem GitHub repositories are in the [nih-cfde](https://github.com/nih-cfde) GitHub organization.

## Issues

Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests. A GitHub user can open a new issue or view open issues for any repository that the user has access to. See the [About Issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues) help page for more information.

## Creating a New Repository Branch

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a Pull Request. See the [About Branches](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-branches) help page for more information.

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository and sign in to GitHub.
2. Select the list of branches using the "Branch: <name>" button.

<img src="images/repo-select-branch-list.png" alt="Select Branches" width="400"/>

3. Type the name of the new branch in the text box and click the "Create branch: < new branch name >" highlighted block.

<img src="images/repo-name-new-branch.png" alt="Create new branch" width="400"/>

<img src="images/repo-new-branch.png" alt="View new branch" width="400"/>

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a Pull Request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. See the [About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) help page for more information.

Pull Requests are used to merge forked repositories or repository branches.

### Accessing Repository Pull Requests

### Closing Pull Requests

You may choose to close a pull request without merging it into the upstream branch. This can be handy if the changes proposed in the branch are no longer needed, or if another solution has been proposed in another branch. See the [Closing a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-a-pull-request) help page for more information.

When closing a Pull Request without merging, both branches will still exist in the repository. However, your changes will only exist on the origional branch.

1. See [Accessing Repository Pull Requests](GitHubUsage.md#accessing-repository-pull-requests) for instructions to access Pull Requests in a GitHub repository.
2. Click the "Close pull request" button under the text box at the bottom of the Pull Request page.

<img src="images/pull-request-close.png" alt="Closed pullr request" width="400"/>

## Searching

Many different powerful ways of searching GitHub exist. See the [About Searching on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-searching-on-github) help page for more information.

Use the GitHub search box to:
