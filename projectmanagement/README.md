### Personnel

Have a *new* team member? Qualified members can sponsor new members by entering new member details in the [Onboarding Form]( https://www.nih-cfde.org/onboarding-form/) on the [CFDE Website](https://www.nih-cfde.org/).

Have an *exiting* team member? The CFDE [Offboarding form](https://www.nih-cfde.org/offboarding-form/) must be filled out for the offboarding member.

If you have a team member who needs to *alter* access levels or affiliations please please [email the helpdesk](support@cfde.atlassian.net) with relevant details.

You can check the onboarding status of any CFDE member by finding their name here [Onboarded CFDE Members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

### Reporting

+ **Deliverables**: Follow the [Delivery Guide](https://github.com/nih-cfde/project-management/blob/master/DeliveryGuide.md) and submit your deliverables to the University of Maryland at least two days before they are due to NIH. The current timeline of deliverables is found in the [Deliverables repository](https://github.com/nih-cfde/deliverables/issues).

+ **Financial Reporting**: By the 6th of each month we need financial information to include dollars spent for labor and, separately, for travel (if any) for each team. The estimates should be fully loaded meaning labor should include salary + benefits + overhead (indirects). Ideally numbers provided will match an eventual invoice or at least be a close approximation. Both numbers can be submitted by email to Bob rocarter@som.umaryland.edu or by Slack to @Bob Carter. 

+ **Change Requests**: 
If changes are needed, please contact Bob Carter (rlc.dcppc@gmail.com) to discuss. Changes need to be negotiated with NIH, so please do not edit the deliverables list.
