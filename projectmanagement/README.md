### Personnel

Have a *new* team member? Send them to the [Onboarding form](https://forms.gle/H3ThBxzYYHdauaKJ8).

Have an *exiting* team member? Send them to the [Offboarding form](https://forms.gle/TQMmwvSGaDCFuVXP9).

If you have a team member who needs to *alter* access levels or affiliations please have them use the link in their Onboarding form Confirmation email to update their Onboarding Form. They can also edit their Onboarding info by going to the [Onboarding form](https://forms.gle/H3ThBxzYYHdauaKJ8) while signed in to Google with the email they originally used to Onboard. Please [email the helpdesk](mailto:coordination+int+1481+4810093048235559374@CFDE.groups.io) after changing your form to ensure any changes are propagated through the CFDE system.

You can check the onboarding status of any CFDE member by finding their name here [Onboarded CFDE Members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

### Reporting

+ **Deliverables**: Follow the [Delivery Guide](https://github.com/nih-cfde/project-management/blob/master/DeliveryGuide.md) and submit your deliverables to the University of Maryland at least two days before they are due to NIH. The current timeline of deliverables is found in the [Deliverables repository](https://github.com/nih-cfde/deliverables/issues) and as an excel sheet in the CFDE Google Drive Project Management folder [Deliverables List](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nEeSyqnCZ1WCjgVOBsWrHGBJEYMiX5Il/view?usp=sharing).

+ **Financial Reporting**: By the 6th of each month we need financial information to include dollars spent for labor and, separately, for travel (if any) for each team. The estimates should be fully loaded meaning labor should include salary + benefits + overhead (indirects). Ideally numbers provided will match an eventual invoice or at least be a close approximation. Both numbers can be submitted by email to Bob rocarter@som.umaryland.edu or by Slack to @Bob Carter. 

+ **Change Requests**: 
If changes are needed, please contact Bob Carter (rlc.dcppc@gmail.com) to discuss. Changes need to be negotiated with NIH, so please do not edit the deliverables list.
