# Workflow for onboarding new members to services (requires admin rights to all resources)

To fully onboard, a new member must:
 - Have a PI or PM fill out the onboarding [form](https://www.nih-cfde.org/onboarding-form/)
 - Accept our GitHub invite
 - Accept our Slack invite
 
 We track those events, as well as our progress in adding them to our resources [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing).

## Onboarding Overview
The Onboarding form will send notifications to support@cfde.atlassian.net whenever the form is filled out. 

A member of the coordination team should begin the onboarding process for new forms *within 2 business days*. Full onboarding for each person is a typically a multi-day process, and can be done by multiple members of the coordination team, because we have to wait for each new onboardee to accept the invitations. The basic workflow is:
  
  - Add them to our Google Group, and send them an invitation GitHub
  - Add them to the correct mailing lists
  - Add their name to the "Welcome" list in the Weekly Announcements
  - Wait for them to accept the invitations

## Onboarding Walkthrough
To onboard new members you will need to go to the [Forminator plug-in](https://www.nih-cfde.org/wp-admin/admin.php?page=forminator-entries) on the CFDE Wordpress site. Here you can view the most recent onboards with date submitted. By selecting submissions you can view the entries made for onboarded individuals. 
Alternatively, you may select **Export** and download a CSV for all submissions. In either case you will need to copy the relevant details and transfer them to the [Onboarding Reponses Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JcTqlkCRPqrSnykqshrVM2XLf_3HJJiPpAb7qBaOug/edit?usp=sharing) where you will begin the onboarding process. 

On this sheet, partially onboarded members will have some boxes checked. Onboarding tasks should be completed (or checked up on) from left to right for each individual.
  
### Google Group adds

  If 'Added to Google Group?' is unchecked:
   - Copy their email address from "Alternate email for Google Drive", if they don't have one, use the email address in "Email Address"
     - Note : If the e-mail is a commercial (.com) address, but not from a big service provider (gmail / hotmail) Google Groups may not give them access, the Onboarding Form recommends users give a non-commercial address, but it's good, as administrator, to be aware that you may need to ask them to change/create a different e-mail for full access. 
   - Note their Title/Position from column P and affiliation from column O
   - Decide what Google Permissions group to add them to:
      - For members of Teams Brown or White **who are working on infrastructure or data access management**, ask Amanda and add them to [CFDE_Admin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_admin/add) only after her explicit approval
      - For everyone else, choose [CFDE_Everyone](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!managemembers/cfde_everyone/add)
   - (You can also reach those pages by going to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!myforums), choosing 'Manage members' for the appropriate group, and then clicking 'Direct add members' on the left side of the screen.)
   - Enter the email address of the person you want to onboard. If you have more than one to add to a given group, you can add multiple, comma-seperated, email addresses
   - Ensure that the welcome message box is filled correctly (see below), then click `Add` at the top of the screen
   - Check the 'Added to Google Group?' box for each person you added

#### Google Group Welcome Messages

 - Add their name and address to the 'Emails' box in this format: `Name <email@example.com>`

 - Check the 'Mailing Lists Assigned??' box for each person you added
 
     NOTE1: I find it hard to read column Q for members that choose more than one list.
     If you prefer, you can read their choices directly off their form. To do that:
       
      - Go to [the form view for onboarding](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sFY6y2eHB3PS0HayEyxXtZOrBJV7lfT8thJ8bL9wKqQ/edit#responses)
      - Click on the 'Individual' tab
      - Click where it says 'achar@ucdavis.edu'. That will open a selection box where you can choose the email address of the member you're working on
      - Choose the right email address
      - Scroll to the bottom of their form to the 'Mailing List Options' section      

### Cross-Pollination Mailing lists

### Special additions for PMs, PIs and Admin contacts

For most places:
- the PI on the grant is the Principal Investigator
- the Administrator Contact is the person I would ask things like "how much money did your grant spend in March?" not things like "hey when is Bobs calendar open"
- the PM is the head PM of that group. the person you contact to find out why their deliverable isn't done, or where some product is. 

If the person you are onboarding is a PI, PM or Administrative contact for *any* team, they should be added to the [Points of Contact](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/PointsOfContact.md) list:
  - Navigate to [Points of Contact](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/PointsOfContact.md) on GitHub
  - Use the edit feature to add them and issue a pull request. For help with pull requests, see the [GitHub Usage Guide](./GitHubUsage.md)
  
 If you are unsure whether a newly onboarded person needs to go on the Point of Contact List, ask Amanda Charbonneau.

If 'Slack Invite Accepted?' is unchecked:
  - Go to [the admin page for slack](https://cfdeworkspace.slack.com/admin/invites#pending) (you may need to log into your Slack account)
