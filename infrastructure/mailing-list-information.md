# Mailing List Information

Open to anyone in consortium, should be listed in on-boarding form. 
- General: No specific topic, literally everyone who is onboarded is in it by default. 

- Announcements: Only announcements. Low traffic, high information density. Opt-in

- OrgHelpForum: Supposed to be for people to ask questions. In practice lots of people wanted to be in it, but no one asks things...they all just email and slack me instead :( Could maybe get deleted. Opt-in

- PIs: Mostly for announcing PI meetings and telling them about reporting deadlines. Anyone can join, but it's aimed at PIs. Opt-in

- PIsPlusNIH: Mostly for announcing meetings and reporting deadlines. Anyone can join, but it's aimed at higher level management people. Currently no traffic. Maybe could get deleted. Opt-in

- ProjectManagement: Mostly for announcing PM meetings and similar. Anyone can join, but it's aimed at PMs. Currently low traffic, but i expect it to go up once DCCs onboard. Opt-in

- Training: For announcing training stuff. Opt-in

- GitHubTracking: This is an automated account that scrapes the daily github traffic for everything in nih-cfde and puts it in a single daily email. Lots of people get it. Only the bot posts. Opt-in 

Restricted to only certain people, should not be listed on on-boarding form:

- coordination: Me, Jeremy and Jose. It gets bot notifications for things like onboarding and offboarding. Will probably add more bots. Basically so we have a little ticket system to make sure someone catches all the things. Can also have discussions. Restricted entry, but people can know it exists. 

- SiteVisits: Discussion list for people who go on DCC visits. Chat is entirely about when people are available, where they're staying, what restaurant you're going to for dinner. It's restricted entry, and I don't even want people who aren't on it to know it exists. I don't know if I still have an active stalker, and I am not interested in finding out for sure via the medium of some random CFDE person mentioning what hotel I'm in. Thanks.

- autohelp: This is a bot that received email from the autohelp+int+851+6545985337373134556@CFDE.groups.io address. Currently, it's all over the documentation, for everything from help with onboarding to COC violations. What I'd like to happen is for someone (@josesanchez1815 ? @jeremywalter ?) to go through all of the CFDE docs and replace it with a bot address for the coordination mailing list for things that are general stuff, and to leave this one for just COC problems. It is restricted, and should not be on the onboarding form. People can know it exists I guess. 

- CFDE-RFC-Admin: This is a list that will be used for the RFC process that we're in the middle of standing up. It is restricted membership, but people can know about it, and I'm open to making the archives public to onboarded members if people want to.
