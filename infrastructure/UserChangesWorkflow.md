# Workflow for changing member information (requires admin rights to all resources)

In general all of the steps needed to make changes that come in through e-mail or the Google Onboarding form are already included in the Offboarding and Onboarding docs. Try to track changes in the Onboarding spreadsheet whenever possible.
## Google Groups
- If a user requests an e-mail change through the onboarding form or other means, we can manually delete the old-email and add a new one. Note: users can change their e-mail in Google Groups without notifying us.
## Groups.io
  Admins can manually change the e-mail
- Go to https://cfde.groups.io/g/General/members
- Paste their email into the 'search' box
- Click on their name 
- In the e-mail box, change the e-mail
- At the bottom of the page, click save
## GitHub
- GitHub IDs and e-mails are the responsibility of the user. Action should only be required here for Offboarding. 
## Slack
- Slack e-mail can be changed in the admin screen: [https://cfdeworkspace.slack.com/admin](https://cfdeworkspace.slack.com/admin)
