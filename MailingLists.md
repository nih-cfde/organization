## Mailing list information

We use groups.io for our mailing lists. We are CFDE@groups.io 

To join the group you *must* have filled out the [onboarding form](https://forms.gle/H3ThBxzYYHdauaKJ8). 
Once you have completed the onboarding form you will be automatically added to the general mailing list, 
as well as any you requested.

You can visit our group, start reading messages and posting them here: https://groups.io/g/CFDE
