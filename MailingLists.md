You can visit our group, start reading messages and posting them here: https://groups.io/g/CFDE

## List of mailing list for the Common Fund Data Ecosystem project

**Announcements:** Open list for announcements about important CFDE milestones, deadlines, meetings and more

**autohelp:** Restricted list: Helpdesk members only. Receives all helpdesk messages.

**GitHubTracking:** Open list with automated updates about the CFDE Github repositories

**General:** No specific topic, literally everyone who is onboarded is in it by default. 

**OrgHelpForum:** Open list to create a searchable history of questions about the organization, 
how things work, and where to find what you need. Unlike the other lists you do *NOT* need to 
be a member of this list to post messages or search the archive

**PIs:** Mostly for announcing PI meetings and telling them about reporting deadlines. Anyone can join, but it's aimed at PIs. Opt-in

**PIsPlusNIH:** For NIH and admin contacts. Strategy, reporting, and NIH items for review.

**Training:** Open list for discussion around Outreach and Training

Restricted to only certain people, should not be listed on on-boarding form:

**Coordination:** Amanda, Jeremy and Jose. It gets bot notifications for things like onboarding and offboarding. Will probably add more bots. Basically so we have a little ticket system to make sure someone catches all the things. Can also have discussions. Restricted entry, but people can know it exists. 

**SiteVisits:** Discussion list for people who go on DCC visits. Chat is entirely about when people are available, where they're staying, what restaurant you're going to for dinner. It's restricted entry, and I don't even want people who aren't on it to know it exists. 

**autohelp:** This is a bot that received email from the autohelp+int+851+6545985337373134556@CFDE.groups.io address. leave this one for just COC problems. It is restricted, and should not be on the onboarding form. People can know it exists I guess. 

**CFDE-RFC-Admin:** This is a list that will be used for the RFC process that we're in the middle of standing up. It is restricted membership, but people can know about it, and I'm open to making the archives public to onboarded members if people want to.
