# Code of Conduct

## CFDE Code of Conduct

All members of the CFDE are expected to agree with the following code
of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation
from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

The Consortium is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of Consortium
members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not
appropriate for any venue, including meetings, presentations, or
discussions.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact our 
[Code of Conduct Team](mailto:autohelp+int+852+1037728591560792003@CFDE.groups.io) 
immediately. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can email
that address using a free single-anonymous email service like
[Anonymouse](http://anonymouse.org/anonemail.html)

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any Consortium event.
