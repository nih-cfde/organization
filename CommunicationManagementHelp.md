## CFDE Communication Management Help Overview

We are using a number of services to communicate and share files:
  - [Github](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#github-help): Code sharing, organization and deliverables tracking
  - [groups.io](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#groupsio-help): mailing lists
  - [Google Drive Teams](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#google-drive-help): file sharing
  - [Slack](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#slack-help): Group chat, forum and instant private messaging

Depending on your role and needs, you may find that the default settings for these services
give you too many, or too few, notifications. On this page you will find instructions for 
altering common settings as well as links out to more detailed information. 

If you are having problems *accessing* these services, please see the [Onboarding Help](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/OnboardingHelp.md)

## GitHub Help

This page is for changing GitHub notification and other settings. For help with *using* GitHub, for e.g. opening issues or making pull requests, see the [GitHub Usage Guide](./GitHubUsage.md)

#### Definitions

- Organization: Our GitHub Organization is https://github.com/nih-cfde This is the location on the web where you can access all of the CFDE github repositories. We also have an 'organization' repository, which is a folder that contains all the meta information about our Organization
- Repository: Each repository or 'repo' is a self-contained collection of documents and code. There can be any number of repositories in our Organization, and anyone in our group can make a new repository. See the [New Repository Guidelines](NewRepositoryGuide.md) for more info
- Team: Each member of our Organization will be assigned to one or more Teams. The Team(s) you are in determine what repositories you have edit access for. By default everyone has at least read access to all CFDE repositories. Teams can also be tagged into conversations and have other useful features. Anyone in our group can make new teams. 
- Pull Request: A Pull Request or 'PR' is the main way to share your own edits to documents in a repository
- Branch: Since many people might work on a document simultanously, when anyone makes an edit to a document GitHub makes that change on a different 'branch', so each person can make their own changes and then submit their version to the group for approval via a Pull Request
- Commit: Essentially saving. When you are making changes to a document in your branch, you need to commit your changes before you leave the page. If you are making a lot of changes, you can do many commits and submit all the changes on your branch as one Pull Request.
- Review Request: To ensure that errors aren't accidently introduced into important code and documents, all Pull Requests must be reviewed by at least one other person before they are merged into the official version
- Merge: Once you have submitted a Pull Request, and it has been approved via review, you can merge your changes, at which point your version of the document is the version displayed in the repository
- Issues: Issues are ways to make comments or requests in a repository

#### Changing Notifications

By default, your Github account will automatically 'watch' repositories and teams that you are added to, and by default it will
email you notifications each time there is a PR, Commit, Review Request, Issue or Comment on any of those repositories, and also
whenever a new repository is made in our Organization. 

However, unless you are actively working in a repository, you probably don't need to be notified of every change. 
There are two places where you will need to change your settings to reduce the number of times GitHub contacts you.

##### Watching Settings

First, make sure you are only watching repos that you are actively interested in tracking. Since everyone in our Organization has at least read access to all our repos, you'll be watching all of them, regardless of how they relate to your role. You can see all the repos you are watching at this link: https://github.com/watching
You should get something like this:

<img src="/images/watching.png" alt="Watch List" width="600"/>

For each repository in the list, decide how often you want to hear about it. There are four options: 'Not Watching', 'Releases Only', 'Watching' and 'Ignoring'
<img src="/images/watchingoptions.png" alt="Watching Options" width="600"/>

For repositories that you actively work in, and would like to be notified of things like PRs and conversations, choose 'Watching'. You can set what types of actions send you notifications using the [Notification Settings](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#notification-settings) instructions below.

For most other repositories, you will likely want to set them to 'Not Watching' or 'Releases Only'. Both of these options will
only send you notifications if someone specifically invokes you or your team in a PR, comment, etc.

If you are sure you will never be interested in a repository, you can set it to 'Ignoring'. This will stop all notifications, even if people specifically mention you. As this is a collaborative project and your colleagues might request your input in places you didn't expect, we do not advise setting CFDE repos to 'Ignoring'. 

##### Notification Settings

Once you have determined which repos you want to watch, you can change what triggers watching notifications, as well as
edit the default behavior of watching everything. You edit these settings at: https://github.com/settings/notifications 

Your current notification settings will look like this:

<img src="/images/toomanynotifications.png" alt="Notification Options" width="400"/>

**Automatic watching section**
To stop GitHub from automatically watching repos in the future, you should uncheck the 'Automatically watch repositories' box. 
You can also stop GitHub from automatically watching any new Teams.

Note that if you uncheck these boxes you will have to specifically turn on 'watching' for specific repos and teams you become interested in later ([See Watching Repos and Teams](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/blob/master/CommunicationManagementHelp.md#watching-repos-and-teams) below). 

**Participating section**
Here you can choose where you receive notifications for discussions you are *actively participating in*. This includes things like PRs or Issues you made, PRs or Issues your have reviewed or commented on, and other conversations where your name is mentioned.
You can get them either only by email, only at your GitHub notifications page (https://github.com/notifications) or get them in both places.

**Watching section**
Here you can choose where you receive notifications for discussions you are *watching*. This includes things like PRs or Issues on repositories you are watching.
You can get them either only by email, only at your GitHub notifications page (https://github.com/notifications) or get them in both places.

Settings to try: Have 'Participating' notifications only emailed to you so you always see them right away, but have 'Watching' notifications only visible on the web, so you can look through them all once a week.

**Vulnerability alerts section**
We suggest checking only the 'Web' option. Most of our repositories don't contain running code, and so won't have security alerts anyway.

**Email notification preferences section**
Here, you can further customize what types of events trigger your alerts. 

- Comments on Issues and Pull Requests: Unchecking this box will stop general notifications about comments on Issues and PRs in your watched repos
- Pull Request reviews: Unchecking this box will stop general notifications about new Review Requests on repos your watched repos
- Pull Request pushes: Unchecking this box will stop general notifications about Merges in your watched repos
- Include your own updates: Checking this box will cause GitHub to email you notifications about things you did. Unchecking this box will stop notifications about your own actions.

Unchecking all of these boxes would cause you to only get email alerts for conversations where you are specifically mentioned or actively participating. 

For more information about notifications see the [GitHub Notification About page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-notifications) or the [GitHub Getting Started with Notifications page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-started-with-notifications)

##### Subscriptions
You can make more fine-grained changes to your notifications by subscribing, or unsubscribing, from specific conversations, PRs, issues, etc; regardless of whether you are watching the repo they happen in. For more information, see the [Subscriptions help page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/subscribing-to-and-unsubscribing-from-notifications) from Github.

##### Watching Repos and Teams

If you have turned off auto-watching, you will need to manually start watching new repos that you would like to follow.

To watch a new repository:
- Go to the main page of that repository (for our project management repo that would be: https://github.com/nih-cfde/project-management)
- In the upper right corner click the `Watch` button and select 'Watching'
- See [the GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository) for more info

To watch a new team:
- Navigate to the nih-cfde Teams page: https://github.com/orgs/nih-cfde/teams
- Click the name of the Team you are interested in (you may have to use the arrows on the right to uncollapse the team lists)
- On the left side of the screen, click the `Watch` button and select 'Watching'
- See [the GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-team-discussions#watching-a-single-teams-discussions) for more info

If you did not find the solution to your problem on this page, please email the [HelpDesk](mailto:autohelp+int+851+6545985337373134556@CFDE.groups.io)

## Google Drive Help

You will have access to two or three different CFDE drives.
 - CFDE Admin: Everyone has view access to this drive. It contains files related to maintaining 
 the CFDE infrastructure and files that need to be locked from direct editing such as the contact
 list created by the onboarding form
 - CFDE Everyone: Everyone has edit access to this drive. It contains the bulk of CFDE files and
 is the main place for collaboration
 - CFDE Steering: This is a restricted access folder for budgets, high level reports and other documents
 intended soley for communication between PIs and the NIH
 
 **All interactions in the CFDE Google Drives are bound by the [CFDE Code of Conduct](./CODEOFCONDUCT.md).**
 
 **All documents in the CFDE Google Drive spaces are assumed to be under the [CFDE License](./LICENSE.md) unless another license is specified in the document.**
 
#### Accessing the drives

You must be logged into Google Drive using the email you specified in your [onboarding form](https://forms.gle/wsBAYevSQNVfG5eF9). 

On the left side of the screen, you should see a button for Team Drives:

## Slack Help

Slack is a group chat system similar to a 90's online chat room. You can use it to talk, to share files, and even to voice chat; and it supports an unlimited number of private and public 'channels' as well as private instant messaging with any number of members. We have already installed a number of apps that allow you to do things like Doodle polls or displaying GitHub issues inside a channel, however members can install others as needed.

All interactions in the CFDE Slack, including inside of private messages and channels are bound by the [CFDE Code of Conduct](./CODEOFCONDUCT.md).

#### Channels
##### Joining Channels
By default, everyone is added to #general and #random, but you can join as many other open channels as you like. To see the current list of available channels and join some:
- Click the *word* 'Channels' in the sidebar <img src="/images/addchannels.png" alt="Channels" width="200"/>
- Browse the list of channels under 'Channels you can join' 

<img src="/images/browse.png" alt="Browse" width="200"/>

- Click on any channel to preview the channel and see if it's what you want
- Click `Join Channel` at the bottom of the screen to join

##### Leaving a Channel
As a member of our Slack community, you must be a part of #general, however you can freely leave and join others. To leave a channel:
- Click the name of the channel in your sidebar to show the channel
- Click the gear icon at the top of your window
- Choose `Leave #ChannelName` It will be the last option in the dropdown menu

##### Adding a Channel
Members are welcome to add channels for topics not currently covered by other channels, and are not restricted to CFDE topics (i.e. a channel that's all cat pictures all the time is perfectly fine). However, all interactions in the CFDE Slack, including private messages and channels are bound by the [CFDE Code of Conduct](./CODEOFCONDUCT.md), and messages that constitute harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

To create a new channel:
- Click on the plus sign in a circle *next* to the word 'Channels' in the sidebar  <img src="/images/channels.png" alt="Channels" width="200"/>
- Choose whether the channel is public or private. Public channels are listed in the directory and joinable by any member, Private channels are not listed in the directory and are invitation only. Channels for large working groups, general discussion, cat photos, etc, should generally be public. Channels for discussing the travel plans of your small working group, steering committees, etc should generally be private. (See [Private messages vs Private Channels]() below for more info.)
- Choose a short, but descriptive name
- If your channel is public, be sure to give it a purpose (description) so people can tell what it's about
- Invite people you think (or know) want to be a part of your channel 
- Click `Create Channel`

#### Getting someones attention
Typing a question intended for one person into #general or another busy channel will likely not result in a response. Luckily, there are several ways to get the attention of one person, a few people, or everyone, in a channel.

##### Call Outs
If you want one, or a few, people to answer a question *publically* you can ask with a callout in a channel. For example, to ask the 2-3 people who might know: "When is the next Project Management meeting?", you can use the `@` to have each person you list get a notification directing them to your message like this:

<img src="/images/callouts.png" alt="callouts" width="500"/>

- If you want everyone who is currently online in that channel to get a notification use `@here` 
- For everyone in the channel, even if they aren't online use `@channel`

#### Private messages
If you want one or a few people to answer a question *privately*, you can start a private message. Slack calls these Direct messages 
To start a new Direct message:
- Click on the plus sign in a circle *next* to the word 'Direct Messages' in the sidebar
- Type the name(s) of who you would like to chat with
- Click `Go`

Once you have at least one message in your direct message history with someone, they will appear as a shortcut under 'Direct Messages'. Only your ~10 most recent private message groups will display here, however the hidden ones still exist. You can get back to any of your direct message histories by following the steps to start a new private message.

#### Private messages vs Private Channels
*Private messages are different from private channels.* 
In a private *channel* anyone in that channel can invite others, it is private in that you need an invitation to join, not that no one else can ever see it. Anyone joining a channel can see it's entire history. Private channels can also have an unlimited number of members (up to everyone in the CFDE).

In a private *message*, (Direct message) no one can leave or join the message group, and the maximum number of members is eight. If you are in a private message, you will see that the gear icon *does* an option to 'Invite another member' to your private message, however if you do that, it just starts a new private session with your new group. The added member cannot see the history of the original group.

#### Threads
Slack supports chat threading. This allows you to continue conversations in a busy Channel without all the replies getting jumbled together. 
To start a new thread:
- Choose a message in the main chat window that you'd like to continue talking about
- Hover over the message with your cursor 
<img src="/images/thread.png" alt="Start a thread" width="400"/>
- On the right hand side, click the speech bubble icon labeled 'Start a thread'
- This will split your chat window and put your message directly after the reply 
<img src="/images/thread2.png" alt="Start a thread" width="400"/>
- In busy channels where the original message quickly scrolls off the screen, you can easily track replies to your threads by clicking on 'Threads' at the top of the sidebar 
<img src="/images/threads3.png" alt="Start a thread" width="400"/>

#### Search
Slack supports global search of your messages, so you don't have to remember what channel you read that important thing in. To search, type your query in the search bar in the top right corner. It doesn't matter what channel you are in when you start your search. 

- To confine your search to one channel, include the channel name, e.g. to find where someone mentioned the meeting in the PM channel search: `#project-management meeting`
- To search all public channels (regardless of whether you are a member) as well as all private channels and private messages that include you, just search your word, e.g. `meeting`
- To search only public and private channels that you are a member of and your private messages, do the above search and then filter the results by checking the 'Only search my channels' box <img src="/images/filter.png" alt="filter" width="300"/>
- You can also filter your results by person, channel, and date range

#### Apps
There are several apps installed on Slack, and you can always install others. To use an app, start by typeing `/` All apps are invoked using the forward slash and then typing an appropriate command. When you type `/`, Slack knows you're trying to call an app and offers you auto-complete suggestions. Most apps respond to `help`, so if you're unsure how to use an app, typing `/AppName help` will generally bring up the options. One useful app is 'remind', which can be used to send yourself, or a channel, some reminder at a specific time. To remind all the project managers that there is a meeting every Wednesday at 2pm, you would type:

`/remind #project-management Project Managers Meeting Wednesdays at 2pm`

And Slack would begin sending a channel notification to the #project-management channel just before their meetings.

#### Reactions
Sometimes you want to react to a message in Slack without having to type words. You can react to any slack message with emoji, similar to the way you can 'heart' tweets on Twitter or 'like' posts on Facebook. To add your reaction, hover your cursor over the message you want to react to, then click on the smiley that appears on the right side of the message. You can then choose from a huge array of emoji to express your feelings about the post.

If you did not find the solution to your problem on this page, please email the [HelpDesk](mailto:autohelp+int+851+6545985337373134556@CFDE.groups.io)

#### Notifications
By default, you will only be notified when someone specifies your name as in `@Amanda Charbonneau` or notifies an entire channel, as in `@here` or `@channel`

You can alter your notifications per channel by:
- Open the channel
- Click the gear icon near the top of the app screen
- Select `Notification preferences`
- Choose your settings

For more fine grained notification changes, see the [Slack help](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201355156)
