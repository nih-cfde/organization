## Onboarding Overview

We are using a number of services to communicate and share files:
  - Github: Code sharing, organization and deliverables tracking
  - groups.io: mailing lists
  - Google Drive Teams: file sharing
  - Slack: Group chat, forum and instant private messaging
  
  
To begin onboarding, you should fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/wsBAYevSQNVfG5eF9)

Within 2 business days of submitting the onboarding form, you will receive 
- an invitation to join the cfdeworkspace on Slack
- an invitation to join nih-cfde on GitHub

**You *must* accept both invitations**

You will also receive a number of confirmation emails for our mailing lists and google drive.

If you did not receive these emails, please check your spam folder. 

## Fixes for Common Access Problems

### GitHub
If you cannot find your GitHub invitation, follow this link to accept on the web: https://github.com/nih-cfde

For help configuring your GitHub notifications and other settings see [Communication Management](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/new/master#github)

### groups.io
You may need to add CFDE@groups.io to your safe sender list in your email client’s contacts
to reliably receive mailing list emails.

For help configuring your groups.io mailing frequency and other settings see [Communication Management](https://github.com/nih-cfde/organization/new/master#groupsio)

### Google Drive
You must be logged into Google Drive using the email you specified in your onboarding form. 
You will have access to two or three different CFDE drives.
 - CFDE Admin: Everyone has view access to this drive. It contains files related to maintaining 
 the CFDE infrastructure and files that need to be locked from direct editing such as the contact
 list created by the onboarding form
 - CFDE Everyone: Everyone has edit access to this drive. It contains the bulk of CFDE files and
 is the main place for collaboration
 - CFDE Steering: This is a restricted access folder for budgets, high level reports and other documents
 intended soley for communication between PIs and the NIH
 
On the left side of the screen, you should see a button for Team Drives:
